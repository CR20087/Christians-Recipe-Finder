### `Recipe Application Start Shorcut` (Recommended)

Runs the app by starting a local development server then running `npm run electron:serve` and opening the app in an electron browser view.

The Christian's Recipe Finder Logo is a shortcut back to the home screen.

As im using a free API plan from spoonacular I have 150 quota daily. To limit the possibility of the Daily limit being reached whislt the app is in use
I have put in place features that check the local cache for data before preforming a request to save and be conservative of the quota.

Manual start up the app are shown at the top of the page. Theese are commands run through terminal.

The run the application the user must first have Node.Js this is because Node allows for web-based computer programs. Without Node the Startup Shortcut will open & close terminal once very quickly.
This solution for exporting the app is NOT ideal but due to the complexities of exporting the app, this is the only method possible. 

Enjoy your Recipe!
